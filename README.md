Objective:
This project aims to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification model leveraging the CIFAR-10 dataset. The primary goal is to train the model to effectively categorize images depicting various objects into one of the ten predetermined classes.

Introduction:
Image classification stands as a fundamental task within computer vision, finding utility in a broad spectrum of applications from facial recognition to autonomous driving. The CIFAR-10 dataset serves as a widely adopted benchmark for image classification endeavors, encompassing 60,000 32x32 color images distributed across 10 distinct classes. These classes represent diverse objects including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

The dataset is partitioned into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, ensuring an equitable distribution of images across each class. This balanced distribution renders CIFAR-10 well-suited for both training and assessing machine learning models.

This project entails the development of a CNN model utilizing TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will undergo training on the training set and subsequent evaluation on the test set, facilitating an assessment of its performance in terms of accuracy and pertinent metrics.
